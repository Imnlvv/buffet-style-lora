# buffet-style-lora

This project presents a generative image model trained in the artistic style of Bernard Buffet using Stable Diffusion + LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). The model was trained on a custom dataset and is publicly available on Hugging Face.

## Project Highlights
- Custom LoRA fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion
- Training performed in Google Colab using Dreambooth
- Model uploaded and shared on Hugging Face
- Prompt-based image generation with high stylistic fidelity

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch
- diffusers / transformers
- Hugging Face Hub
- Google Colab
